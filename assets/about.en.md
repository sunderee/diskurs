_Diskurs_ is a cross-platform mobile thesaurus application with the capability of querying corpora for samples of word usages. It supports the three major Balkan languages: Slovenian, Croatian, and Serbian.

The application is based on the APIs provided by [kontekst.io](https://www.kontekst.io/). You can read more about their work by following [this link](https://www.kontekst.io/o-slovarju).

_Diskurs_ was developed by Peter Aleksander Bizjak (you can [contact the developer here](mailto:peter.aleksander.bizjak@ipm-digital.si)). Special thanks go to Matej Alekov for providing application design and logos (you can [contact him here](mailto:matej@openlab.s)) and Marko Plahuta from [Virostatiq](http://virostatiq.com/about/) for providing APIs used by kontekst.io and _Diskurs_.
